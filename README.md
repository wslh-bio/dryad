**Dryad** is a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) pipeline for examining prokaryote relatedness. Dryad can perform a reference free analysis and/or SNP analysis.

Dryad analyzes fasta files that have been processed either by [Spriggan](https://github.com/wslh-bio/spriggan) or by [PHoeNIx](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix). Dryad is split into two major workflows:
1. A workflow dedicated to fine scale outbreak investigations that are within a singular outbreak. This process uses a reference to determine relatedness and snp distances. The reference can be removed from the alignment based workflow to create a phylogenetic tree that gives a high resolution look at a singular outbreak.
2. A workflow dedicated to identifying historical relatedness across multiple years and multiple outbreaks without the use of a reference. This alignment free workflow gives a low resolution look at historical relatedness.

## Usage
> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data. To use Dryad, a Nextflow minimum version of 24.04.2.5914 is needed.

To run an alignment free comparison, use:

```bash
nextflow run wslh-bio/dryad \
   -latest \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --alignment_free
```

Alternatively, to run an alignment based comparison, use:

```bash
nextflow run wslh-bio/dryad \
   -latest \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --fasta <REFERENCE_FASTA | random> \
   --alignment_based 
```

To run both and alignment based and an alignment free comparison, use:
```bash
nextflow run wslh-bio/dryad \
   -latest \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --fasta <REFERENCE_FASTA | random> \
   --alignment_based \
   --alignment_free
```

* Nextflow caches previously run pipelines. This can result in an older version of a pipeline being utilized. To get the most up-to-date version of a pipeline like Dryad, use the `-latest` tag.

## Input
Prepare a samplesheet with your input data with each row representing one fasta file. The samplesheet will look as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:  
| sample | fasta |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| sample_1 | 2024_1.contigs.fa |
| sample_2 | 2024_2.contigs.fa |

## Parameters
Dryad's main parameters and their defaults are shown in the table below:

| Parameter | Parameter description and defaults | Example usage |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| input | Path to comma-separated file containing information about the samples in the experiment | --input <PATH_TO_SAMPLESHEET> |
| outdir | Output directory where the results will be saved. Absolute path must be used for storage on cloud infrastructure | --outdir <DESIRED_OUTPUT_PATH> |
| profile | Denotes how to access containerized software. | -profile aws |
| fasta | Reference fasta used for alignment based comparisons. Default is no reference fasta. | --fasta <PATH_TO_REF_FASTA> |
| fasta random | Reference fasta used for alignment based comparisons is chosen by Parsnp's algorithm. Default is not to use a random fasta file as a reference. | --fasta random |
| alignment_based | Performs a fine scale analysis within a singular outbreak | --alignment_based |
| alignment_free | Performs a historical analysis across multiple years and outbreaks | --alignment_free |
| task.cpus | Denotes how many cpus to use for Mashtree. Default task.cpus is 2. |--task.cpus 4 |
| cg_tree_model | Tells IQ-TREE what [model](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Substitution-Models) to use. Default cg_tree_model is GTR+G | --cg_tree_model "GTR+G" |
| parsnp_partition | Tells parsnp the minimum partition amount or to not partition. Default is --no-partition.* | --parsnp_partition "--min-partition-size 50" |
| skip_quast | If the data was run through pheonix or another pipeline with a quality check, skips QUAST and the summary options. Default is to run QUAST as if quality summaries were not previously run. | --skip_quast |
| add_reference | Used to include reference in outputs. This option should not be used if you are using --fasta random. Default is false | --add_reference |

*If you are running an alignment based workflow on >100 samples, it may be beneficial to take into account a higher partitioning value than the default of 100. More information can be found in parsnp 2.0's [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38352342/#:~:text=Parsnp%20v2%20provides%20users%20with,combined%20into%20a%20final%20alignment.).

## Workflow
![dryad_workflow](assets/Dryadv4.10.drawio.png)

### 1. Universal Steps
   - Enter assembled FASTA genomes into a samplesheet. 
   - [QUAST v5.2.0](http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast) is used to determine assembly quality if skip_quast is not indicated.
   - QUAST results are summarized with a custom python script to increase readability.
   
### 2. Comparison Steps
   - Historical Comparison
      - [Mashtree v1.4.6](https://github.com/lskatz/mashtree) generates a phylogenetic tree using Mash distances. 
   - Fine scale Comparison
      - **Bootstrapping in IQ-TREE2 requires at least 4 genomes. If less than 4 genomes are used, IQ-TREE2 will not perform bootstrapping.**
      - [Parsnp v2.0.5](https://github.com/marbl/parsnp) is used to perform a core genome alignment.
      - [IQ-TREE2 v2.3.4](https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE) is used for inferring a phylogenetic tree.
      - [Snp-dists v0.8.2](https://github.com/tseemann/snp-dists) is used to calculate the SNP distance matrix.

## Output
An example of Dryad's output directory structure for both alignment based and alignment free steps can be seen below. These directories will not include QUAST if `--skip_quast` is used:
